# Statmodding: Zeros
This section will teach you how to statmod an account to have all 0s. Now, there arent really any specific numbers to give because if can be done so many different ways, however the math is pretty simple.

### How-to
First, set your `resist all` and your `armor` stats both to `2,147,483,647`. This will take care of zeroing out your toughness and your life sheetstats.

Next, in game, note down your toons base mainstat stats (numbers it shows for str, dex, int, and vit without any gear on or paragon applied to them.

Next, make some gear. Make it primal. Add affixes to it that when added up will bump those mainstat numbert to multiples of 5 when loaded in (little math is required here). We want multipuls of 5 because each point of paragon is worth 5 and parago is how we will negate it to 0.

Once you've sorted out the affixes on your gear, add negative paragon to cancel out the mainstats.

Now you should have 0s.

# Doing Damage with a Zeros Statmod
Again there are many different ways one can do this, so I'll give an example for Demon hunter.

Set your `critical hit damage` to `-150` and add the `Sharp Shooter` passive somewhere on your gear. Then just stack damage and damage % on your gear and weapon (with this you can actually use a weapon).

In game when you first load up with will show your sheet dps with actual damage, but as the buff from sharp shooter stacks up, it will bring you down to 0.

But when acrtually attacking things the buf resets and boom your have dammage, but will always reset back to 0.
