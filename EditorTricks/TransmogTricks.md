# Transmog Tricks
When modding in the editor, if you go to the mystic tab when viewing an item, you can transmog items with any item in the game. And sometimes you can get cool results, like blackout armor, pink armor, brown armor and more! A lot of it will need to be self discovery, tho I will list some that I have found here to help get you started.  
  
### Blackout Gear (Most classes)  
* **Boots:** Gloves of Worship  
* **Pants, Boots, Gloves, Chest:** Illusory Boots  
  
### Pink Gear (Demon Hunter)
* **Pants, Boots, Gloves:** Blackfeather  
* **Weapons:** Testing Art Crossbow 2  
  
Will add more soon!
