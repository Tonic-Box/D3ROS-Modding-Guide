# How to Edit Switch Saves
* NOTE: Only applies to any other editor besides My version. My version does not require any of this.  
  
For any of you who mod on switch, Im sure youve descovered by now that the editor errors out when trying to open a switch save. Most people think the only way arround this is completely fresh save files, which is partially true. But I'm here to shed a bit more light.

Yes! Contrary to popular opinion, you can infact edit played switch toons in the editor. The only thing that needs to be fresh is the .dat files outside of the ``heroes/`` folder. So, generate fresh unplayed versions of those, and use them when editing toons.

Then, just only swap in and out your toon files (located in the ``heroes/`` folder) when you edit them.

And thats pretty much it. :)
