# Getting Started: Gear Modding
Gear modding can be a blast and opens up a whole new world of exploration. This is by no means an _end-all-be-all_ comprehancive guide. So get weird with it. Try weird things, expiriment. Thats really what it's all about!  
  However, I do have a few words of warning for you to save you the heart ache of crashing yourself over and over untill you figgure it out.
  
* Never put sockets on gems themselves
* Always change mystic roll count when setting the 7th affex in the mystic tab
* For perfect affix rolls, remember to always set the "Primal" flag under the Properties tab
* Remember to throw 3 sockets on all gear pieces
* The PVP amulet has a built in socket, so only put 2 sockets on it max, otherwise the save will crash
