# Monk Wind Lazer
This is just a cool effect I found that is only possible, as far a I know, on Nintndo Switch due to its ability to break the Attack Speed cap via memory editing.  
  
### Instructions  
1. In Edizon, turn on: `8x Attack Speed`, `inf energy`, and `no cooldown`  
2. Assign the skill `Way of the Hundred Fists` with the rune `Windforce Flurry`  
3. Just hold down the skill
