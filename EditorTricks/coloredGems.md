### Adding an Affix to Colored Gems
1. Go to the "Mystic" Tab
2. set the old affix to something random
3. set the new affix to the affix you want on the gem.  
_(The Affix wont show visually on the gems stats in game, but it's there in the background)_  
_(NOTE: Do not put sockets on gems)_


### Augmenting the colored gems
1. Load up Toon in game that contains your modded Gem(s)
2. Go to the cube.
3. Augment (you can augment them as a stack)  
_(The Augment wont show visually on the gems stats in game, but it's there in the background)_


### Socketing Modded Colored Gems
1. Load up Toon in game that contains your modded Gem(s)
2. Drop all but 1 of the Gems
3. Socket that 1
4. Pick up the stack you dropped and repeat.  
_(Its important you do it this way and only socket 1 at a time, otherwise you will loose the Affix and Augment you placed on the gems)_
