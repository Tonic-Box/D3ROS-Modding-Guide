# Raw Tabs
**In the words of CKY circa 2015**  

_"The raw tab is so complex that doing a video on it would be 5 - 7 hours long to watch. There are to many values that are unclear what they do. What is known is all data that is there is the base save file.. Anything that is a byte array if you change any one value it will just break the save..  
  In short there realy is no way to do a concise and easily understood tutorial on what each object can and cant do. This is where you the user should just play with it untill it either brakes or does something cool.."_
  
  But... When I get the time, I may attempt a write-up on the raw tabs, We'll see. :p
